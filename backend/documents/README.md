# Sample Documents for Testing

This directory should contain 5 PDF documents for the search tool to index.

For demonstration purposes, you can add any PDF documents here. The application will automatically:

1. Extract text from PDF files
2. Apply OCR for image-based content
3. Detect sections and structure
4. Index the content for searching

## Recommended Document Types

- Technical standards (ISO, ANSI, etc.)
- Reference manuals
- Regulatory documents
- Specifications
- Guidelines

## File Requirements

- Format: PDF (.pdf extension)
- Encoding: Any (the tool handles both text-based and image-based PDFs)
- Language: English content (search interface supports EN/FR)

## Example Files to Add

You can create or add sample PDF files such as:
- `standard_001.pdf`
- `technical_manual.pdf`
- `safety_guidelines.pdf`
- `quality_procedures.pdf`
- `environmental_standards.pdf`

The application will automatically detect and index any PDF files placed in this directory when the backend starts.
